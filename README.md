This code is for the Mooqita neural network challenge.

neural_net.rb contains my implementation of neural nets.
test_neural_net.rb contains some tests for my implementation.

The remaining files are from the challenge. I have modified neuro.rb
to make main.rb work as intended. However all the real machinery is
in neural_net.rb.

To figure out how to use my neural nets, look at NeuralNetwork in neuro.rb
or the network tests in test_neural_net.rb.
